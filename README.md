# Introduction

## Purpose
The purpose of this program is to practice C, and coding in general. 

## Motivation
I was motivated to do this by the drive to expand my knowledge and skillset. I consider this a foundation to doing more.

# Usage
## N/A
Currently, there is no need for me to direct how to use this program, and it is in such a \[WIP\] state that it would not be feasible for me to describe how to use it.

# Credits
This program heavily follows the [Build-Your-Own-Editor](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/) tutorial. I take no credit for designing this program, and I am not attempting to pass this program off as my own, rather this is merely to learn from.

If eventually I add more functionality than what the tutorial instructs on, I will add a section to talk about my own extensions.
